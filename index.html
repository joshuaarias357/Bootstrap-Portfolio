                    <p>This is a short paragraph about me. I will replace it in the near future. Again, my name is Josh Arias and I love to surf and am really looking forward to getting better at this whole coding thing. <br><br> I hope to someday have a group of clients that I can work remotely with and just run their website and marketing but work from a beach somewhere. Maybe Nicaragua, that place was awesome. Or even somewhere in Indo, needs good wifi tho. <br><br>This is a short paragraph about me. I will replace it in the near future.
